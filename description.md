# CeriNote v2.0: The Complete Clinical Guide 🎙️🧠

Welcome to **CeriNote**, the next-generation AI infrastructure built specifically for **Clinical Psychologists** and Licensed Therapists. 

This guide explains everything you need to know about the platform, from how it protects patient privacy to how it uses advanced AI to automate your clinical documentation.

---

## 🌟 What is CeriNote?
CeriNote is a **high-security, AI-driven clinical workspace**. Instead of spending hours writing notes after therapy sessions, CeriNote "listens" to your session, understands the psychological nuances, and automatically drafts professional, medical-grade documentation for you.

---

## 🔒 1. Security & Privacy (The "Safe-Box" Architecture)
In mental health, privacy is #1. CeriNote uses a **10/10 Security Blueprint**:

*   **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: This is military-grade encryption. Every word of your transcripts and reports is encrypted at rest. Even if someone stole the database, they couldn't read a single letter.
*   **Zero-Retention Policy**: By default, CeriNote is "amnesic." It deletes the raw audio recording the second it finishes converting it to text. No patient voices are stored on our servers.
*   **Mandatory Digital Consent**: You cannot start a recording without the system logging that the patient has given consent. This creates a legal audit trail for your protection.
*   **Hardened Infrastructure**: We use advanced web security (HSTS, CSP, and XSS protection) to ensure that only you can access your clinical workspace.
*   **Audit Logging**: Every single action—whenever a report is viewed, deleted, or generated—is logged with a timestamp for forensic clinical accountability.

## 🎙️ 2. The Recording Workspace (Multi-Mode Input)
CeriNote adapts to how you work. You have two ways to capture data:

1.  **AI Voice Capture**: Record your session live. The AI will separate who is talking and filter out "small talk" (like the weather or payments).
2.  **Manual Clinical Note**: If you don't want to record, you can type your raw, messy clinical shorthand into the "Manual Text" box. The AI will still use its medical intelligence to turn those notes into a beautiful, structured report.

## 🧠 3. Clinical Intelligence Core (The "AI Brain")
CeriNote doesn't just transcribe; it **understands**. Our specialized pipeline includes:

### 📄 Professional Reporting
The AI drafts a complete clinical report including:
*   **Psychological Formulation**: Identifying why the patient is struggling (vulnerabilities, triggers, maintaining factors).
*   **Therapeutic Modalities**: It recognizes if you used CBT, DBT, ACT, or Psychoanalytic techniques and documents them correctly.
*   **MSE (Mental Status Exam)**: Automatically extracts observations about the patient's mood, affect, speech, and thought process.

### 🔢 Diagnostic Intelligence (ICD-10 / DSM-5)
The system analyzes the session and suggests the most likely **ICD-10 codes** and **DSM-5-TR** alignments. It even tells you how "confident" it is in each suggestion. *Note: This is for your review only; you make the final billing decision.*

### 📈 Rating Scale Estimation
CeriNote estimates scores for common psychiatric scales based on what the patient said:
*   **PHQ-9** (Depression)
*   **GAD-7** (Anxiety)
*   **YMRS** (Mania)
*   **HAM-D** (Depression)

---

## 🚨 4. Risk Detection (The Safety Net)
CeriNote has a built-in safety engine that scans every millisecond of text for "Red Flags." If the system detects any of the following, a high-visibility alert appears instantly:
*   **Suicide Risk & Self-Harm**
*   **Psychosis & Thought Disorder**
*   **Homicidal Ideation**
*   **Substance Abuse**

---

## 📊 5. Longitudinal Patient Tracking
CeriNote is built for **long-term care**, not just single sessions. 

In your **Longitudinal Dashboard**, you can see:
*   **Trend Sparklines**: Visual graphs that show if a patient's depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) is getting better or worse over weeks and months.
*   **Risk History**: A clear view of any past safety alerts for a patient.
*   **Quick Search**: Find any clinical keyword (e.g., "catastrophizing") across months of sessions in seconds.

---

## 📤 6. Exporting & Integration
Once your report is ready, you can export it in three ways:
*   **Clinical PDF**: A professional document ready for your physical files.
*   **Plain Text**: Copy and paste into your existing EHR software (like Epic or Cerner).
*   **FHIR-JSON**: A standard medical data format for modern healthcare systems.

## 🎨 7. The Experience (Obsidian-Style UI)
We know therapists spend a lot of time on screens. CeriNote features a **Premium Dark-Theme (Obsidian-style)** interface that is easy on the eyes, lightning-fast, and works perfectly on your desktop, laptop, or tablet.

---

**Summary**: CeriNote v2.0 is more than a recorder; it's a clinical assistant that takes over your paperwork, monitors patient safety, and tracks long-term progress so you can focus 100% on the human in front of you.
